I'm someone who often installs virtual machines for my testing, and I've become very accustomed to working in that environment as it's more efficient for me. I find it frustrating to work in a regular environment now, it's quite challenging for me haha.

I'm going to share my personal configuration of Bspwm + Polybar + VSC + nvim + Kitty + Spotify with you, which can be installed on any Linux distribution designed for Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, CTFs, etc.

{:.note title="Attention"}
I must say that I'm not a developer, so the code is quite straightforward. It lacks validations and could be infinitely improved. When installing, we'll see how everything is set up. I've kept it this way to catch any errors. It serves its purpose, which is to install the entire environment on top of a freshly installed image. I encourage you to modify it to your liking. It's something I'm planning to do myself as I prepare for OSCP, and I take any opportunity to practice scripting."

Good Luck
